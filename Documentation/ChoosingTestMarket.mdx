title: Choosing a Test Market
---
Before creating the Geoholdout Test, it is essential to refer to the **Test Market Report** to select the best markets to conduct your new strategy test.

We have created the rank on different regions. **The higher the rank (1 being the highest), the more sensitive it is to run a geoholdout test in the region**.

For example, if you want to run a new out-of-home campaign, the best region to begin the test on the above report is queenland, south_australia and victoria. If you were to run the test for 14 days (see the duration), you will be able to detect a minimum uplift of 17.5% (effect size). The smaller the effect size is, the more sensitive the model will be for you to understand the impact of the new strategy.
