title: Creating a Geoholdout
---
# Overview
- For the best result of Geoholdout test, we recommend launching a campaign or strategic change in only one state.
- It is important to pick the right state, for the right length of time to get a accurate reflection of the impact. We recommend picking a state that is representative of your marketing efforts.
- Bimodal will then collect the data over a period of time and compare that state to the rest of the country, taking the previous performance into consideration.
- You will receive a report on the incremental number of conversion and the cost per incremental conversion to know whether a specific campaign or strategy is effective compared to the current strategy.

- Go to [Geoholdout Test](https://bimodal.io/geoholdout-test)
- Select **New Test** on the right side of the page
- Put in the name of the **Test** (eg. NSW Radio Nov 2023)
- Select the corresponding **conversion** you would like to use.
- Choose the **direction of change** you think may happen because of the change: increase or decrease. The result will let you know whether it is true.
- Choose the **Test Region**. This is the region you are running a different strategy in.
- Select the **Exogenous Data**: this is to exclude any data that could impact the result. For example, a sales period.
- Select the **Channel** that you would like to measure. You can select multiple channels at once. For example, you can pick all the TV channels if you are running a different TV strategy within a specific region.
- Put in the **Date of Experiment Start** (this will be your campaign/ strategy launch date).
- Put in the **Date of Experiment End**
- Write a **Description** of the strategy and your hypothesis of the strategy for future references.
- Wait and check the result after the experiment ends.
