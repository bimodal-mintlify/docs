title: About Incrementality
---
Bimodal makes it easy for marketers to measure the true impact of their marketing campaigns and advertising efforts.

An incrementality test is a crucial method in marketing because it helps address the challenging task of distinguishing causality from correlation, ultimately contributing to achieving a more accurate understanding of the impact of marketing efforts.

Similar to an A/B test for your media mix, an incrementality test in the Bimodal platform enables media buyers to quantify the true ROI of a specific campaign. There are two types of incrementality tests in the Bimodal platform:
- **Geoholdout:** Measures the effectiveness of a marketing campaign or strategy in specific geographic areas.
- **Uplift Test:** Determines whether marketing campaigns have positively influenced customer behavior, such as sales or page visits, compared to previous marketing activities.

Both tests are automated tools that provide easy access to current best-practice algorithms for analyzing your live data.

# Questions that a Geoholdout Test can answer

- Is our new radio strategy in QLD effective?
- Does it improve ROI if we spend more on Meta?
- What happens if we lower the spend on Google for a month?
- Is it better if we run a new strategy across 3 channels vs. only 1 channel?
- Was our TV campaign a good idea? Or was it a waste of time and money?
- etc.
