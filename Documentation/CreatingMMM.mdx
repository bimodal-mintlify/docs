- Select the corresponding **Spend Data**, **Exogenous Data**, **Organic Data** and **Conversion Data** to include in the MMM input. Selecting the right data sources will help you create a more effective model.
    - **Spend Data**: the spend data sources you would like to include in the model.
    - **Exogenous Data**: any data to exclude from the model to reduce the noise.
    - **Organic Data**: data from any non-paid channels.
    - **Conversion Data**: the conversion point to optimize towards.

- Fine-tune the model with **Advanced Options**:
    - **Iterations**: the times the model is iterating itself ( we recommend using the default setting 2000 times)
    - **Trials**: the times the model will run from scratch (we recommend using the default setting 5 times)
    - **Saturation Curve Shape**: our team will help select the best model for your spending. We recommend keeping it to the default setting.
    - **Earliest Date**: The date you would like the model to trace back to. We recommend including **at least 9 monthsâ€™ worth of data**.
    - **Latest Date**: The latest date you would like the model to include.
