**Bimodal makes it easy to know where you might best put your next advertising dollar.** Our Media Mix Modelling uses techniques based upon modern techniques to estimate the ROI and point of diminishing return for each channel.

This creates recommendations on where to most profitably reduce/increase spend, and even a fully optimised media mix.

After performing tests or re-allocating budgets, these models will then update automatically to show the latest results.
