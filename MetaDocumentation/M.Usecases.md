**CORE**
- Creating a Geoholdout (Reading the test market report, choosing a market, running the test, reading the results, making a better decision)
- Creating an MMM
- Reading the results of a Budget Optimisation

**PHILOSOPHICAL**
- “The loop” - test and learn, MMM → Hypothesis → Test → Update
- Understanding refreshes and test calibrations
- Straight Uplift Tests

**CORE BUT NOT A PRIORITY**
- Onboarding - data, subchannel definitions, etc.
