- Test market details 
	- Currently sorted by 'rank' (under more details, function of size, min detectable effect, reliability
		- Aidan: Get better idea of exactly how this works, and redesign it so this is clear to a curious user for increased face validity.
		- Sort-by options? 
- **Better phrasing for 'Abs lift in zero'**
- Need link to documentation (when it’s presentable) clearly somewhere on page. 
  EITHER:
    - Overall documentation link in global sidebar
    - Relevant documentation link on given page
- Would be good to have some context clues that something is clickable (eg. Channel mix detailed graph)
	- Link colour vs text colour)
- Channel mix default graph issues to fix:
    - fixes graph dimensions based on window size on page load, doesn’t update on change 
	      Assumes only window focus; actively bad experience if user instinctively makes the window bigger to see it clearer
    - Resets inputs (eg., date range on click)
- Custom Graph menu
	- Make the test clickable (vs '...' -> view)
- Graph improvements:
	- Colours should contrast 
		  **Particularly control vs treatment vs confidence bands**
	- Easier zoom in? (scroll to zoom?)
