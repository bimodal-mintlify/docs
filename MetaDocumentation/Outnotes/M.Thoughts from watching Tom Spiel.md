How to do what Tom does; for everyone; on their own.

Edit - suggestion (Geo robust to market changes) - so long as it applies to the rest of the country” - shift to “so long as this change wasn’t limited to your test region”?  
→ Allows for

Really strong intro, but would be harder to do written; and VERY hard to do without demonstrable data.  
Thoughts on grammar: collective first ‘we’ - (Aidan default); likely to be interpreted instead as ‘exclusive we' (Bimodal; vs you). Instead, probably a good idea to use second person for empowerment)

Honestly, a good model for the 3m video.  
-Welcome to the dash  
-Here’s the initial graph  
-Look at the fancy version with details turned on. - We populate these automatically from your platforms, but you can define things yourself if you need it.  
-Really like the FB to 0 example - Might be great idea to use example that _illustrates_ Geoholdout’s robustness to shifts in market conditions
-”This would be really damaging to drop a whole ad account to 0. Instead, we drop just _one_ state to 0”  
-Traditionally you might (XYZ), but this is very vulnerable to shifts in marketing conditions. (Potentially give example) We perform a Geoholdout test. A Geoholdout takes how the rest of your market behaves historically and over the test period, and uses it to build a model for how your target region would behave if you kept going as usual. Now you can compare the actual data from your market test to the projected model.

Counterthought: 
Explain Geoholdout first with illustrative example of shift, then highlight → “Here we can see the huge strength of the Geoholdout, as if we’d done the typical approach of (?), (if you’re lucky and spot it, you’d know the test was meaningless?) you’d either have to discard the test and try it again, or worse, take away the wrong conclusion!

The dotted line (demarcates) where our test starts. (We) can see that even though the market changed, we’ve got a baseline that accounts for that. Here we can see the difference between what we would expect if we’d made no change and what recorded from the test. We’ve made

By default we keep this as accessible as possible, but if you want to see the more detailed statistical results you can find them here, under the ‘details’ tab
