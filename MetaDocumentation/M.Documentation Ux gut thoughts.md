Documentation Ux gut thoughts:
- Landing page
    - V quick explainer of how to use documentation.
    - Potentially quicklinks to most-used chapters
- ‘Table-of-contents’ type sidebar 
	- Open by default, collapsible?
- Search functionality top-right
    - or/and search at top of sidebar?
    - Top-right feels like it would be important for framing the negative space more nicely 
	    - and intuitively/readily accessible
- Each page consisting of:
	- explanatory text
	- illustrative images
		- Example data labels?
			- Example 'real' labels
			- Role-Labels
				- Eg. Media Channel 1; Region A

Some link from documentation page to relevant course section 
	At top, bottom, or RHS of page? 
	Hit the Bimodal ‘course’ symbol for deeper explanation of what’s happening and why? 
		Include on splash!

Align ‘chapters’ to sidebar categories in Bimodal Ux
