# **Adstock Decay**
- Adstock decay curves tell you how long an ad has an impact on the market after running.
- Similar to “time to conversion”, this graph is crucial for building an intuition of a channel.
- For example, the following graph shows that the impact of the ads will drop rapidly from the first day when customers have seen the ad, and the impact will be close to zero by around day 10.

- The pink bars show the optimized budget %, and the blue bars show the current budget percentage.
- The above example suggests that the GoogleAds_Performance_Max budget should be reduced to close to 0%.
- Instead, the advertiser should increase the budget in GoogleAds_Other and TV_Seven as well as TV_Ten. If the marketing budget remains the same, the advertiser should increase the spend on GoogleAds_Other by $91.198.06 (per 7 days) to reach 57.67% of the total spend for the maximum ROI.
